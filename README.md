# 🏰 Tower Defense Game

🎯 **Semester 4 OOP Course Project – Ranked Top 3 among all projects**  
Developed an engaging and visually dynamic **Tower Defense Game** using **JavaFX**, demonstrating strong **object-oriented design**, **game development principles**, and **UI/UX design skills**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **JavaFX-based Tower Defense game** where players strategically place towers to defend their base against waves of enemies.  

The game combines **real-time strategy mechanics** with **object-oriented programming concepts**, showcasing principles such as **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, and **design patterns** (e.g., Factory, Observer, and Singleton).  

It was developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course in **Semester 4** at the **German University in Cairo (GUC)**, and was **ranked among the Top 3 projects** for its gameplay quality, architecture, and design.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

1. **Start from the Main Menu** – choose to start a new game or load a previous one.  
2. **Place Towers Strategically** – defend your base by placing towers along the path of enemies.  
3. **Survive Enemy Waves** – each round introduces new challenges and faster enemies.  
4. **Upgrade Towers and Earn Coins** – optimize your defense strategy.  
5. **Reach the Final Wave** – win the game or face defeat if your base is destroyed.

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Design Highlights

- **Encapsulation:** Each entity (Tower, Enemy, Projectile) encapsulates its state and behavior.  
- **Inheritance:** Base classes define shared logic, extended by specialized tower and enemy subclasses.  
- **Polymorphism:** Dynamic method overriding for unique attack and movement behaviors.  
- **Design Patterns:**
  - **Factory Pattern** – for creating different types of towers and enemies.  
  - **Observer Pattern** – for updating the UI and game state reactively.  
  - **Singleton Pattern** – for managing game state and resources globally.
